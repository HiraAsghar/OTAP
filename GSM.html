<h1> Over the air programming with GSM</h1>
<h2>OUR Project</h2>
<p>Our project focuses on using <bold> GSM/GPRS</bold> based technology to implement the concept of Over the air
programming, , as the controllers are deployed in those areas where wifi access isn’t available the GSM
will help to overcome this issue. Currently scope of our project is restricted to implementation of GSM
based OTAP for microcontroller. Programs written in Arduino IDE can be uploaded to the
microcontroller over the air using GPRS and executed without the need of any wired connections or
WIFI protocol.</p>
<h2>WHY GSM ??? </h2>
<p>Over the air programming (OTAP)
has been previously done with Wi-Fi (ESP32) in such a way that the program has been upgraded through
ESP32 into to master and then this master change the program or performances of their slaves In this age of growing technology and innovation, there is a substantial increase in the development and
implementation of IoT devices over the last few years. These devices are deployed in vast numbers and
are in frequent use for many years, so they require timely updates for fixing bugs and adding new
features to device’s software in order to keep them up-to-date. Hence, there arises a need for a fully
automated process for large scale software updates of such embedded devices.</br>Considering this need, we propose a project based on an IoT system which will be updated by using
Over The Air Programming (OTAP) with GSM with Atmega328p. In OTAP, programs written in Arduino
IDE can be directly uploaded to microcontroller of the IoT system using GSM without any wired
connection or Wi-Fi protocol. In many applications IoT systems are installed in remote areas where Wi-Fi
accessibility is not possible so conventional technique (OTAP by using Wi-Fi) for sending updates to the
system is failed. The use of GSM in this project will solve this problem.</p>
